# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this application is to generate random passwords based on user input. The user can specify the length of the password as well as the different character types it will contain. There is also validation preventing the user from generating passwords above or below a certain length as well as inputting invalid parameters.

## Requirements

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
